# Getting Started with HardFOC ESP-IDF Project Tools

Welcome to the HardFOC ESP-IDF Project Tools! This guide will help you **integrate these development scripts into your existing ESP-IDF project** for enhanced multi-application build management and development workflows.

> **📋 Important**: These tools are designed to be **integrated into your ESP-IDF project**, not used as standalone applications.

## Integration Methods

Choose the best method to integrate these tools into your ESP-IDF project:

### Method 1: Submodule Integration (Recommended)

**Best for**: Version-controlled projects with team collaboration

```bash
# Navigate to your ESP-IDF project
cd your-esp-idf-project

# Add tools as submodule
git submodule add https://github.com/hardfoc/hf-espidf-project-tools.git scripts

# Your project structure:
# your-esp-idf-project/
# ├── CMakeLists.txt
# ├── app_config.yml
# ├── main/
# └── scripts/                    # Project tools
#     ├── build_app.sh
#     └── flash_app.sh

# Start building
./scripts/build_app.sh your_app Release
```

### Method 2: Direct Clone Integration

**Best for**: Quick setup and experimentation

```bash
# Navigate to your ESP-IDF project
cd your-esp-idf-project

# Clone tools directly
git clone https://github.com/hardfoc/hf-espidf-project-tools.git scripts

# Start building
./scripts/build_app.sh your_app Release
```

### Method 3: Shared Tools Directory

**Best for**: Multiple projects using the same tools

```bash
# Create shared tools directory
mkdir -p ~/shared-esp32-tools
cd ~/shared-esp32-tools
git clone https://github.com/hardfoc/hf-espidf-project-tools.git .

# In each ESP-IDF project, use --project-path
cd your-esp-idf-project
~/shared-esp32-tools/build_app.sh --project-path . your_app Release
```

### Method 4: Automated Project Setup

**Best for**: Creating new ESP-IDF projects with tools pre-integrated

```bash
# Clone the tools repository
git clone https://github.com/hardfoc/hf-espidf-project-tools.git
cd hf-espidf-project-tools

# Create a complete ESP-IDF project with tools
./setup_basic.sh my-awesome-project

# Navigate to your new project
cd my-awesome-project

# Build and flash
./scripts/build_app.sh main_app Release
./scripts/flash_app.sh flash main_app Release
```

**That's it!** You now have a complete ESP-IDF project with:
- ✅ ESP-IDF installed and configured
- ✅ Build system set up
- ✅ `app_config.yml` with basic app
- ✅ CMakeLists.txt files
- ✅ Basic `main.cpp` template
- ✅ All development scripts ready to use

### Option 2: Add to Existing Project

If you already have an ESP-IDF project:

```bash
# Navigate to your ESP-IDF project
cd your-esp-idf-project

# Add tools as submodule
git submodule add https://github.com/hardfoc/hf-espidf-project-tools.git scripts

# Create app_config.yml (see Configuration guide)
# Set up CMakeLists.txt files
# Start building!
```

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Git** installed on your system
- **Internet connection** for downloading ESP-IDF
- **Write permissions** in your working directory
- **Basic understanding** of ESP-IDF development (for existing projects)
